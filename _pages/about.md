I am an M.S. student in Computer Science at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM).
My research focuses on intelligent optimization algorithms and real-time robotic path planning, 
with an emphasis on improving convergence stability and algorithmic efficiency in dynamic environments.

I combine theoretical algorithm design with practical software engineering skills.
I am currently preparing to apply for PhD programs starting Fall 2026.
